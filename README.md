# IC_protobot

## Overview

This is a clone of the shared project repository made by the members of the University of Hawaii Robotic Space Exploration Team(link). Our team's goal is to creat a six wheeled robot that can drive, operate a manipulator arm, detect life, and autonomously navigate which we will officially enter into the University Rover Challenge(link), June 2022. This repository contains the software module prototypes which we worked diligently on in order to prove the architectural concepts laid out in our Critical Design Review(link).

## Robot Operating System (ROS)

ROS is an open source robotics middleware suite and is the premier framework for robotic rapid prototyping. The ROS wiki(link) is an outstanding resource to learn more so I won't go into detail here. The project uses ROS for the majority of the robot's communication between components and functionality. Each software developer on the project completed the ROS Tutorials(link) and below is a demonstration of ROS nodes talking to one another and executing commands.

## Web App Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The ROS network connects can connect to web browsers via a web socket, allowing data to be sent, recieved, and displayed directly on the browser. Commands are transferred wirelessly using the http protocol, which can support large amounts of bandwidth. The web server was made using Node.js/Express and the data is displayed using html/css/javascript. The video below shows a demo of the earliest prototype where a video feed and three topics are subscribed who's data is displayed on the homepage. Javascript allows raw keyboard input (in this case the up arrow and down arrow) to send commands to the ros network. 

### The keyboard arrows are pressed and the linearX velocity rises and falls accordingly.

### Text input in an html form is sent to the ROS network and broadcasted by a node.

## Motor Encoders
The robot uses ten motors, six for forward and backward acceleration and four for steering. We are using the (https://www.pololu.com/product/3284) Roboclaw motor encoders which communicate over serial ports. A 'roboclaw' object was created using C++ which acts as the bridge between the linux serial ports and the actual encoders (source(link)). This object is used by the ROS node (source(link)) to properly send and recieve data and control when the wheels spin.

## Installation

### Dependencies

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rosbridge-suite
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rosbridge-server
sudo apt install nodejs npm

### Getting Started:

#### Terminal 1 (runs ros core through the rosbridge (web socket package) launch file):

cd catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch

#### Terminal 2 (runs the package I made that listens to /score topic which uses std_msgs/Int64 messages):
cd catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun listener_package score_listener

#### Terminal 3 (runs the web app):
cd webapp
npm install
npm run dev

#### Web Browser:
http://localhost:3000 -->
